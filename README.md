# Positive Multiple of 4 Sum Calculator

This Java program calculates the sum of positive integers that are multiples of 4. The program prompts the user to enter a positive even number and continues to do so until a non-positive or odd number is entered. It then calculates and displays the total sum of positive numbers that are multiples of 4.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Main.java file.
2. Compile the Java program using `javac Main.java`.
3. Run the program using `java Main`.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number (`n`).
2. It checks if `n` is a positive even number and divisible by 4.
3. If `n` meets these conditions, it adds it to a running total.
4. The program continues to prompt the user for input until a non-positive or odd number is entered.
5. After the loop, it displays the total sum of positive numbers that are multiples of 4.
